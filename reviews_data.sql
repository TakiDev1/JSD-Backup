9	11	11	5	This is hands down the best sports car mod I've ever used in BeamNG. The handling is spot on - feels like driving a real car. I especially love the different engine options that completely change the personality of the car. The Stage 3 package is my favorite for track use.	2025-03-05 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-05 06:31:21.225478
10	10	11	4	Excellent model and physics. The attention to detail is impressive - even the gauges react accurately to car behavior. My only small complaint is that the tire smoke effect could be a bit more pronounced for dramatic drifting. Otherwise, perfect!	2025-03-10 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-10 06:31:21.225478
11	7	11	5	As someone who drifts a lot in game, I was skeptical about how this sports car would handle sideways action - but I was blown away! Even though it's not primarily a drift car, the chassis balance is so well done that it's actually fantastic for technical drifting. The customization options are incredible too.	2025-03-15 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-15 06:31:21.225478
12	12	11	4	Great physics model and looks stunning. The cockpit view is incredibly detailed and the engine sounds are perfect. I've spent hours just fine-tuning different setups. Lost one star only because I wish there were more wheel options.	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478
13	8	11	5	This mod has completely changed my BeamNG experience. The handling is so responsive and predictable that I've started using it for hotlapping practice that actually translates to my real-life track days. Worth every penny!	2025-04-04 06:31:21.225478	2025-04-04 06:31:21.225478
14	7	12	5	As my username suggests, I'm obsessed with drift cars, and this is by far the most authentic drift experience in BeamNG. The steering angle kit is perfectly implemented, and the way the car transitions between corners feels just like the real thing. The different power levels let you progress as your skills improve.	2025-02-03 06:31:21.225478	2025-02-03 06:31:21.225478
15	14	12	5	I've been looking for a proper drift car that doesn't feel arcade-like, and the JSD DriftKing delivers in every way. The suspension setup is perfect - you can really feel the weight transfer during transitions. The customization options are endless! I've created about 10 different builds from street-legal to competition spec.	2025-02-08 06:31:21.225478	2025-02-08 06:31:21.225478
16	6	12	4	Really great drift car with excellent physics. The engine sound is perfect - you can hear when you're about to lose traction just from the sound. Only reason for 4 stars is I would love to see more body kit options in a future update.	2025-02-23 06:31:21.225478	2025-02-23 06:31:21.225478
17	12	12	4	The handling model is incredibly realistic. You really need to master weight transfer and throttle control to get good drift angles. I especially appreciate how the different tire compounds actually make a significant difference in grip levels. Great work!	2025-03-10 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-10 06:31:21.225478
18	11	12	5	Even though I normally prefer grip driving, this mod converted me to drifting! The way it progressively breaks traction is so satisfying, and you can really feel when you've nailed a perfect transition. The visual customization options are amazing too.	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478
19	9	13	5	This is exactly what I've been wanting in BeamNG! The suspension travel is insane, and the way it soaks up bumps at high speed is perfect. I can hit jumps that would destroy any other vehicle and just keep going. The detailed undercarriage with visible suspension components is a nice touch too.	2025-03-15 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-15 06:31:21.225478
20	13	13	5	As a dirt racing enthusiast, I couldn't be happier with this Trophy Truck. The way it handles rough terrain at speed is incredible - the suspension physics are spot on. I love how the different terrain types actually affect handling in realistic ways. The authentic engine sound gets your adrenaline pumping!	2025-03-20 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-20 06:31:21.225478
21	8	13	4	Excellent offroad vehicle with amazing capabilities. The long travel suspension is perfectly modeled and the truck feels properly weighted. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish it had a few more livery options.	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478	2025-03-25 06:31:21.225478
22	14	13	5	Worth every penny! The attention to detail is incredible - from the suspension articulation to the way the body flexes slightly under stress. I was hesitant about the price, but after seeing the quality and how much work went into it, it's completely justified.	2025-04-04 06:31:21.225478	2025-04-04 06:31:21.225478
23	8	14	5	As a huge rally fan, I was looking for an authentic rally experience in BeamNG, and this mod delivers perfectly! The handling on different surfaces feels incredibly realistic - the way it slides on gravel but grips on tarmac is spot on. The anti-lag system and turbo sounds are just icing on the cake.	2025-02-13 06:31:59.804902	2025-02-13 06:31:59.804902
24	13	14	5	This is exactly what BeamNG was missing - a proper rally car with authentic handling characteristics. The different tuning options for various surfaces are incredibly well thought out. I love the historically accurate livery options too - brings back memories of the golden era of rally!	2025-02-23 06:31:59.804902	2025-02-23 06:31:59.804902
25	9	14	4	Great rally car with excellent physics. The turbo model is the most realistic I've experienced in any game - you can really feel the lag at low RPM and the surge of power when it spools up. My only minor complaint is that I wish there were a few more modern livery options.	2025-03-05 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-05 06:31:59.804902
26	11	14	5	This mod has changed how I play BeamNG! The handling is so satisfying - that perfect balance between grip and controllable slides. The attention to detail in the cockpit view is amazing, especially the working gauges. I've spent hours just creating different setups for different rally stages.	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902
27	7	14	4	Even though I'm primarily a drift enthusiast, this rally car has become one of my favorites. The handling model is superb, and it's actually great for practicing techniques that carry over to drifting. The sounds are perfect too!	2025-03-25 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-25 06:31:59.804902
28	10	15	5	This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a muscle car mod! The raw power and slightly wild handling captures the essence of classic American muscle perfectly. The engine sounds are absolutely spot-on - you can feel the rumble through your controller. The customization options let you build anything from a stock cruiser to a drag strip monster.	2025-01-04 06:31:59.804902	2025-01-04 06:31:59.804902
29	12	15	4	Great muscle car with authentic handling characteristics. It feels appropriately heavy yet powerful, and the slight understeer followed by easy power oversteer is exactly how these cars should behave. The different exhaust options affecting the sound is a nice touch! Lost one star only because I wish there were a few more wheel options.	2025-01-24 06:31:59.804902	2025-01-24 06:31:59.804902
30	6	15	5	As someone who owns a classic muscle car in real life, I'm impressed by how authentic this mod feels. The weight transfer, the way it squats under acceleration, and the progressive breakaway of the rear end are all perfectly modeled. The attention to detail in the engine bay is amazing too!	2025-02-13 06:31:59.804902	2025-02-13 06:31:59.804902
31	14	15	4	The sound design alone is worth the price! You can tell they recorded a real engine - the idle, acceleration, and deceleration all sound perfectly authentic. The handling model is great too - challenging but controllable once you get the hang of it.	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902
32	9	16	5	This is the best offroad vehicle I've ever used in BeamNG, hands down! The articulation in the suspension is incredible - you can crawl over obstacles that would stop other vehicles dead. The different differential lock settings make a huge difference in capability, and the interior details are amazing. Worth every penny!	2025-01-24 06:31:59.804902	2025-01-24 06:31:59.804902
33	13	16	5	As someone who does a lot of rock crawling scenarios in BeamNG, this mod is absolutely perfect. The suspension flex is incredibly realistic, and the way the vehicle finds traction on uneven surfaces is exactly how it should be. The detailed underbody with visible drivetrain components is a nice touch too!	2025-02-03 06:31:59.804902	2025-02-03 06:31:59.804902
34	6	16	4	Great offroad vehicle with excellent capabilities. The multiple differential lock options give you so much control over how the vehicle behaves in different scenarios. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I wish there were more roof rack accessory options.	2025-02-23 06:31:59.804902	2025-02-23 06:31:59.804902
35	8	16	5	I was skeptical about the price, but after trying it, I can say it's absolutely worth it! The level of detail in both the visuals and the physics is outstanding. I especially love the functional interior with all the working gauges and switches. This has become my go-to vehicle for exploring the more remote areas of the maps.	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-15 06:31:59.804902
36	11	17	5	As a premium subscriber, this exclusive Rally X mod is worth the subscription alone! The physics are on another level compared to standard mods - you can feel every subtle weight transfer and suspension movement. The stage-specific tuning options are incredibly useful and show the level of thought that went into this. Absolutely outstanding work!	2025-03-27 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-27 06:31:59.804902
37	7	17	5	This premium exclusive mod is simply incredible. The advanced physics model makes it feel so much more connected to the road, yet still lively and playful when you want it to be. The exclusive Championship Edition livery is gorgeous, and the tuning preset created with the rally driver input is perfectly balanced. This is the new standard for rally cars in BeamNG.	2025-03-30 06:31:59.804902	2025-03-30 06:31:59.804902
38	14	17	5	The Rally X is easily the most sophisticated rally car available for BeamNG. The progressive throttle mapping gives you so much control in technical sections, and the differential settings are incredibly detailed. The premium-exclusive features are well worth it - the tuning presets alone save hours of setup time. Absolutely phenomenal work!	2025-04-04 06:31:59.804902	2025-04-04 06:31:59.804902
39	9	17	5	I switched to a premium subscription specifically for this mod, and I don't regret it one bit! The handling is unbelievably good - it somehow manages to be both forgiving for beginners and deep enough for advanced users. The rally driver input really shows in how natural the car feels when pushed to the limit. Simply the best rally experience in BeamNG.	2025-04-09 06:31:59.804902	2025-04-09 06:31:59.804902
40	6	3	3	Decent mod with good visuals, but the handling feels a bit off. Too much understeer in corners. Worth the purchase if you're specifically looking for this type of vehicle, but there are better options available.	2025-03-10 06:32:38.930104	2025-03-10 06:32:38.930104
41	8	3	3	Mixed feelings about this one. The exterior modeling is excellent and the customization options are nice, but the suspension feels too stiff even on the softest settings. Also had some texture glitches on certain parts.	2025-03-15 06:32:38.930104	2025-03-15 06:32:38.930104
42	10	3	4	Pretty solid mod overall. The model is well-detailed and the physics are generally good. There's a small issue with the brake lights sometimes, but otherwise it performs well.	2025-03-20 06:32:38.930104	2025-03-20 06:32:38.930104
43	12	3	4	Really enjoying this mod. The handling is challenging in a fun way, and it looks fantastic. Only giving 4 stars because it's a bit demanding on system resources compared to similar mods.	2025-03-25 06:32:38.930104	2025-03-25 06:32:38.930104
44	7	3	5	Been using this for about a week now and it's become my go-to vehicle. The suspension tuning is spot on and it's visually stunning. Performs great even with my mid-range PC. Highly recommended!	2025-03-30 06:32:38.930104	2025-03-30 06:32:38.930104
