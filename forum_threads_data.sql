4	2	4	Getting 'Missing dependencies' error with Pessima racing mod	I just purchased the Pessima Racing Edition mod but I'm getting a 'Missing dependencies' error when trying to load it in the game. I've already installed the base game Pessima, but it's still not working.\n\nI'm using BeamNG.drive version 0.26.2.0 and have tried reinstalling both the base car and the mod.

26	4	11	Request: American Muscle Car Pack	I'd like to request a comprehensive American muscle car pack covering the golden era from the 60s and 70s.\n\nIt would be amazing to have 3-4 iconic models with historically accurate trim levels, engine options, and visual configurations. Proper sound design with those rumbling V8s would be essential!\n\nBonus points for including drag racing parts and options, as well as 'restomod' configurations with modern suspension and braking systems.\n\nIs there enough interest in classic American muscle to make this worth developing?	f	f	318	2025-04-08 06:22:48.39647	2025-04-10 06:22:48.39647	0

29	6	3	Understanding BeamNG's Jbeam physics system for modders	I've noticed some confusion about how BeamNG's physics system works, so I thought I'd start a technical thread to help modders understand the basics of the Jbeam system.\n\nAt its core, BeamNG uses a soft-body physics model where vehicles are constructed from nodes (points in 3D space) connected by beams (connections between nodes). This allows for realistic deformation and dynamic handling characteristics.\n\nKey concepts to understand:\n\n1. **Nodes**: Think of these as the 'joints' of your vehicle. They have mass and interact with the world.\n\n2. **Beams**: These connect nodes and have properties like strength, deformation limits, and spring/damping values.\n\n3. **Weight Balance**: Node placement and mass significantly affect handling. Always check weight distribution!\n\n4. **Collision Triangles**: These define the visible collision mesh for the vehicle.\n\nWhen creating mods, it's crucial to ensure your node setup accurately represents the structure of the vehicle. Improper node placement can lead to unrealistic deformation or poor handling characteristics.\n\nFor those looking to dive deeper, I recommend studying existing Jbeam files and using the in-game node/beam visualization tools.\n\nAny other technical questions about the physics system? Post them below and I'll try to answer!	t	f	362	2025-03-10 06:22:48.39647	2025-03-20 06:22:48.39647	0
30	6	12	Optimization techniques for high-poly vehicle models	I've been working on a highly detailed vehicle mod (approximately 2.4 million polygons in its raw form), and I'm struggling with optimization while maintaining visual quality.\n\nI've tried decimation in Blender, but I'm losing too much detail in critical areas like the engine bay and interior. What techniques are you all using to optimize high-poly models while preserving the important details?\n\nSome specific questions:\n\n1. What polygon count do you target for exterior body panels vs. mechanical components?\n\n2. Are there parts that can be lower poly without noticeable quality loss?\n\n3. Any specific LOD (Level of Detail) strategies that work well in BeamNG?\n\n4. How do you handle high-res textures - are you using normal maps to fake detail on lower-poly models?\n\nAny advice from experienced modders would be greatly appreciated!	f	f	204	2025-04-18 06:22:48.39647	2025-04-22 06:22:48.39647	0
