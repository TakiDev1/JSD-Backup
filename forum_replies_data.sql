17	7	11	I'm absolutely loving the Offroad Monster truck! The suspension articulation is incredible - you can crawl over almost anything. Plus, the detailed undercarriage with all the driveshafts and differentials visible is a nice touch. Worth every penny.	2025-03-09 03:13:50.505	2025-03-09 03:13:50.505
18	7	12	For me it's got to be the Compact Rally. It's not as flashy as some of the other mods, but the handling model is just perfect. Feels exactly like throwing around a 90s rally car, especially on gravel. The different setup options for tarmac vs dirt are super well implemented too.	2025-03-07 23:13:50.505	2025-03-07 23:13:50.505
19	7	7	The Compact Rally is definitely on my wishlist! I've seen some great videos of it in action. Has anyone tried the Hotrod V8? I'm curious if the engine sound is as good as it looks in the preview.	2025-03-08 21:13:50.505	2025-03-08 21:13:50.505
20	7	5	I've got the Hotrod V8 and can confirm the sound design is exceptional. They must have recorded a real engine because the idle rumble and high RPM roar are spot on. It's also got different exhaust options that actually change the sound profile. My only complaint is that it's a bit too tail-happy on keyboard controls, but with a wheel it's manageable.	2025-03-08 03:13:50.505	2025-03-08 03:13:50.505
21	8	1	We're definitely planning to expand into more track content! We have a mountain touge course in development right now that should be ready in about a month. It's inspired by Japanese mountain passes with tight hairpins and technical sections.\n\nWe're also working on a large airport/industrial area that can be configured for drift events, time attack, or drag racing. If there are specific types of environments you'd like to see, please let us know!	2025-04-04 16:13:50.505	2025-04-04 16:13:50.505
22	8	8	That sounds amazing! I'd love to see a dedicated rallycross track with mixed surfaces. Something with jumps, water splashes, and alternating tarmac/dirt sections would be perfect for testing the rally cars.	2025-04-03 15:13:50.505	2025-04-03 15:13:50.505
23	8	9	I'd pay good money for a proper recreation of some iconic real-world tracks. Something like Pikes Peak or Goodwood would be incredible for testing hillclimb builds.	2025-04-05 12:13:50.505	2025-04-05 12:13:50.505
24	9	6	Here's my JSD Velocity X on the coastal highway! [imagine a screenshot was linked here] The aerodynamic parts kit totally transforms the look. I'm running the Stage 3 performance package and it absolutely flies.	2025-03-10 20:13:50.505	2025-03-10 20:13:50.505
25	9	10	Check out this action shot of the Trophy Truck mid-jump! [imagine a screenshot was linked here] The suspension travel is incredible, landed this perfectly from about 30 feet up and kept going. The desert map is perfect for this beast.	2025-03-10 12:13:50.505	2025-03-10 12:13:50.505
26	9	9	Those are awesome shots! The Trophy Truck looks insane in mid-air. Here's another one of my Bandit at sunset with the new light bar mod: [imagine a screenshot was linked here] The volumetric dust effects really add to the atmosphere.	2025-03-09 17:13:50.505	2025-03-09 17:13:50.505
27	10	5	I would absolutely buy this! Kei cars are so underrepresented in racing games despite being super fun to drive. The tiny wheelbase and limited power makes them really rewarding when you get the most out of them.	2025-03-01 05:13:50.505	2025-03-01 05:13:50.505
28	10	2	Thanks for the suggestion! We've actually been considering a 90s Japanese Kei sports car for our next project. It's great to see there's interest in this. Would you prefer a more stock-focused accurate reproduction, or something with lots of modification options for engine swaps and wider body kits?	2025-02-27 16:13:50.505	2025-02-27 16:13:50.505
29	10	10	Personally, I'd love to see both! Start with an historically accurate base model that captures the essence of these quirky cars, but then also include some wild modification options. Part of the appeal of Kei cars is how people modify them far beyond their original specs while keeping the compact dimensions.	2025-02-28 03:13:50.505	2025-02-28 03:13:50.505
30	10	11	Another vote for this! I'd especially love to see some of the quirky features these cars had - like the Cappuccino's removable roof panels that could be stored in the trunk. The engineering that went into these tiny powerhouses is fascinating.	2025-03-02 03:13:50.505	2025-03-02 03:13:50.505
31	11	8	I've been wanting a proper muscle car pack for ages! Especially interested in seeing some Mopar representation - a good Challenger or Charger equivalent would be amazing. With authentic V8 sounds and visual customization options, this would be an instant buy.	2025-04-23 04:13:50.505	2025-04-23 04:13:50.505
32	11	1	We're definitely interested in creating some American muscle! It's a bit challenging to get the suspension dynamics right since these cars handle so differently from modern vehicles, but we're up for the challenge. I've added this to our development roadmap to explore after our current projects are complete. Thanks for the suggestion!	2025-04-22 00:13:50.505	2025-04-22 00:13:50.505
33	12	5	This looks incredible! The suspension travel in that preview video is insane. Will there be different livery options available? And please tell me we can adjust the anti-lag system for those sweet backfires!	2025-04-10 07:13:50.505	2025-04-10 07:13:50.505
34	12	2	Thanks for the excitement! Yes, we'll have 8 different livery options at launch, plus a customizable one where you can change the base colors. And the anti-lag is fully configurable - you can adjust timing, intensity, and even disable it completely if you prefer a cleaner sound. The backfire effects have dynamic lighting too!	2025-04-11 03:13:50.505	2025-04-11 03:13:50.505
35	12	10	Day one purchase for me! Will premium subscribers get any exclusive liveries or parts with this one? The suspension looks perfect for the rally scenarios I like to set up.	2025-04-10 22:13:50.505	2025-04-10 22:13:50.505
36	12	2	Premium subscribers will get an exclusive 'Championship Edition' livery with custom mudflaps and light pod configuration. They'll also receive a tuning preset file that we developed with the help of an actual rally driver for the perfect gravel setup. Hope you enjoy it!	2025-04-10 00:13:50.505	2025-04-10 00:13:50.505
37	13	12	Absolutely beautiful model! The attention to detail on the interior is outstanding. I'm a sucker for classic sports cars with their analog driving feel. Will we be able to toggle between original-spec performance and enhanced modern options?	2025-03-05 01:13:50.505	2025-03-05 01:13:50.505
38	13	1	Thank you for the kind words! Yes, we've implemented a unique system for this car where you can toggle between 'Classic' and 'Restomod' configurations. Classic gives you the authentic 60s driving experience with period-correct limitations, while Restomod maintains the vintage look but with modern suspension geometry, braking performance, and optional engine enhancements. You can even mix and match - like keeping the vintage engine but upgrading the suspension.	2025-03-03 22:13:50.505	2025-03-03 22:13:50.505
39	13	6	The sound in that showcase video is amazing! Did you record an actual vintage engine for this? The exhaust note has that perfect raspy tone that modern cars just don't have.	2025-03-03 12:13:50.505	2025-03-03 12:13:50.505
40	13	1	Good ear! We actually recorded a restored 1967 sports car with a similar engine configuration. We captured dozens of audio samples at different RPMs and load conditions to get that authentic sound. The in-game engine note dynamically changes based on load, RPM, and even exhaust configuration if you modify it.	2025-03-03 21:13:50.505	2025-03-03 21:13:50.505
41	14	12	This is incredibly helpful, thanks! I've been struggling with getting the suspension geometry right on my mod. One question - what's the best approach for modeling anti-roll bars in the Jbeam system? I've tried a few methods but can't get the right balance between roll stiffness and articulation.	2025-03-20 07:13:50.505	2025-03-20 07:13:50.505
42	14	3	Great question about anti-roll bars! The most effective method I've found is to use dedicated anti-roll bar beams with specific spring and damping values, rather than just stiffening the existing suspension beams. This allows for more natural articulation while still controlling body roll.\n\nYou'll want to create beams that connect the left and right suspension components (usually at the control arms) with carefully tuned beam properties. The key parameters to focus on are:\n\n- `springExpansion` and `springCompression`: These control the stiffness of the anti-roll effect\n- `dampExpansion` and `dampCompression`: Keep these relatively low to avoid affecting rapid suspension movements\n\nThe BeamNG Pickup is a good reference model to study - check out its anti-roll bar implementation in the Jbeam files.	2025-03-19 11:13:50.505	2025-03-19 11:13:50.505
43	14	10	I'm having trouble with wheels clipping through fenders during extreme compression. Is there a recommended way to set up collision properly between suspension components and body panels?	2025-03-19 19:13:50.505	2025-03-19 19:13:50.505
44	14	3	For wheel-to-fender collision, you need to ensure you have proper collision triangles defined on both the wheel well and the wheel itself. A common mistake is forgetting to add collision triangles to the inner fender surfaces.\n\nYou can also add 'stopped' beam properties to create hard stops for suspension travel before visual clipping occurs. Look for the `beamPrecompression` and `beamDeform` parameters - these can be tuned to create progressive stiffening as the suspension approaches maximum compression.\n\nIf you're still having issues, check that your wheel collision mesh isn't too simplified. Sometimes adding a few more collision triangles to represent the tire sidewall can solve persistent clipping problems.	2025-03-19 08:13:50.505	2025-03-19 08:13:50.505
45	15	9	I've had good results using a multi-tier LOD system with these general polygon targets:\n\n- Exterior (visible from distance): ~100k polys\n- Engine bay components: ~150k polys combined\n- Interior: ~120k polys\n- Undercarriage: ~80k polys\n\nThe key is being strategic about where you maintain detail. For example, cluster more polygons around complex curves and panel gaps, while simplified flat surfaces. Normal maps are essential for maintaining the appearance of small details like panel stamping and fabric textures.	2025-03-04 08:13:50.505	2025-03-04 08:13:50.505
46	15	3	Great question about optimization! Here's my approach:\n\n1. For mechanical parts like engine components, you can often reduce interior/hidden geometry substantially. Players rarely see the inside of an engine block or transmission case.\n\n2. Use normal maps aggressively for surface details like vents, grilles, and interior textures.\n\n3. For LOD strategy, I recommend 3 levels with approximately 60% and 30% of original poly count. LOD distance in BeamNG is quite generous.\n\n4. Texture resolution matters more than you might think - a well-textured lower-poly model often looks better than a high-poly model with basic textures. 2K textures for exteriors and 1K for smaller parts is usually sufficient.\n\n5. Look for redundant edge loops and n-gons in your model - these are often easy targets for optimization.\n\nHappy to review your model if you want to share some screenshots of the wireframe!	2025-03-04 10:13:50.505	2025-03-04 10:13:50.505
47	15	12	Thank you both for the detailed advice! I've started implementing a more aggressive LOD system and focusing my high-poly detail on the parts that are most visible during gameplay. The normal map suggestion was particularly helpful - I've managed to move a lot of small details like bolts and panel seams to normal maps instead of geometry.\n\nOne follow-up question: for transparent parts like headlights and glass, are there any special considerations for optimization? They seem particularly demanding on performance.	2025-03-02 11:13:50.505	2025-03-02 11:13:50.505
48	15	3	Excellent question about transparent parts! They do require special handling:\n\n1. Transparent materials are indeed more performance-heavy due to the rendering order requirements. Keep polygon count especially low for these parts.\n\n2. For headlights, model only the visible outer lens and reflector in detail. The interior bulb and housing can be much lower poly or even just textured.\n\n3. For glass, avoid double-sided materials when possible. It's better to model thin glass with single-sided faces than use double-sided materials.\n\n4. Limit overlapping transparent layers - each layer of transparency adds rendering cost.\n\n5. For complex headlight assemblies, consider using masked/cutout transparency instead of true transparency for internal details.\n\nImplementing these techniques can significantly improve performance without noticeable visual quality loss.	2025-03-03 05:13:50.505	2025-03-03 05:13:50.505

86	13	1	Thank you for the kind words! Yes, we've implemented a unique system for this car where you can toggle between 'Classic' and 'Restomod' configurations. Classic gives you the authentic 60s driving experience with period-correct limitations, while Restomod maintains the vintage look but with modern suspension geometry, braking performance, and optional engine enhancements. You can even mix and match - like keeping the vintage engine but upgrading the suspension.	2025-04-17 06:19:30.279903	2025-04-17 06:19:30.279903

88	13	1	Good ear! We actually recorded a restored 1967 sports car with a similar engine configuration.

89	14	12	This is incredibly helpful, thanks! I've been struggling with getting the suspension geometry right on my mod. One question - what's the best approach for modeling anti-roll bars in the Jbeam system? I've tried a few methods but can't get the right balance between roll stiffness and articulation.	2025-03-11 06:19:30.279903	2025-03-11 06:19:30.279903
90	14	3	Great question about anti-roll bars! The most effective method I've found is to use dedicated anti-roll bar beams with specific spring and damping values, rather than just stiffening the existing suspension beams. This allows for more natural articulation while still controlling body roll.\n\nYou'll want to create beams that connect the left and right suspension components (usually at the control arms) with carefully tuned beam properties. The key parameters to focus on are:\n\n- `springExpansion` and `springCompression`: These control the stiffness of the anti-roll effect\n- `dampExpansion` and `dampCompression`: Keep these relatively low to avoid affecting rapid suspension movements\n\nThe BeamNG Pickup is a good reference model to study - check out its anti-roll bar implementation in the Jbeam files.	2025-03-12 06:19:30.279903	2025-03-12 06:19:30.279903
91	14	10	I'm having trouble with wheels clipping through fenders during extreme compression. Is there a recommended way to set up collision properly between suspension components and body panels?	2025-03-15 06:19:30.279903	2025-03-15 06:19:30.279903
92	14	3	For wheel-to-fender collision, you need to ensure you have proper collision triangles defined on both the wheel well and the wheel itself. A common mistake is forgetting to add collision triangles to the inner fender surfaces.\n\nYou can also add 'stopped' beam properties to create hard stops for suspension travel before visual clipping occurs. Look for the `beamPrecompression` and `beamDeform` parameters - these can be tuned to create progressive stiffening as the suspension approaches maximum compression.\n\nIf you're still having issues, check that your wheel collision mesh isn't too simplified. Sometimes adding a few more collision triangles to represent the tire sidewall can solve persistent clipping problems.	2025-03-20 06:19:30.279903	2025-03-20 06:19:30.279903
93	15	9	I've had good results using a multi-tier LOD system with these general polygon targets:\n\n- Exterior (visible from distance): ~100k polys\n- Engine bay components: ~150k polys combined\n- Interior: ~120k polys\n- Undercarriage: ~80k polys\n\nThe key is being strategic about where you maintain detail. For example, cluster more polygons around complex curves and panel gaps, while simplified flat surfaces. Normal maps are essential for maintaining the appearance of small details like panel stamping and fabric textures.	2025-04-18 06:19:30.279903	2025-04-18 06:19:30.279903
94	15	3	Great question about optimization! Here's my approach:\n\n1. For mechanical parts like engine components, you can often reduce interior/hidden geometry substantially. Players rarely see the inside of an engine block or transmission case.\n\n2. Use normal maps aggressively for surface details like vents, grilles, and interior textures.\n\n3. For LOD strategy, I recommend 3 levels with approximately 60% and 30% of original poly count. LOD distance in BeamNG is quite generous.\n\n4. Texture resolution matters more than you might think - a well-textured lower-poly model often looks better than a high-poly model with basic textures. 2K textures for exteriors and 1K for smaller parts is usually sufficient.\n\n5. Look for redundant edge loops and n-gons in your model - these are often easy targets for optimization.\n\nHappy to review your model if you want to share some screenshots of the wireframe!	2025-04-19 06:19:30.279903	2025-04-19 06:19:30.279903
95	15	12	Thank you both for the detailed advice! I've started implementing a more aggressive LOD system and focusing my high-poly detail on the parts that are most visible during gameplay. The normal map suggestion was particularly helpful - I've managed to move a lot of small details like bolts and panel seams to normal maps instead of geometry.\n\nOne follow-up question: for transparent parts like headlights and glass, are there any special considerations for optimization? They seem particularly demanding on performance.	2025-04-21 06:19:30.279903	2025-04-21 06:19:30.279903
96	15	3	Excellent question about transparent parts! They do require special handling:\n\n1. Transparent materials are indeed more performance-heavy due to the rendering order requirements. Keep polygon count especially low for these parts.\n\n2. For headlights, model only the visible outer lens and reflector in detail. The interior bulb and housing can be much lower poly or even just textured.\n\n3. For glass, avoid double-sided materials when possible. It's better to model thin glass with single-sided faces than use double-sided materials.\n\n4. Limit overlapping transparent layers - each layer of transparency adds rendering cost.\n\n5. For complex headlight assemblies, consider using masked/cutout transparency instead of true transparency for internal details.\n\nImplementing these techniques can significantly improve performance without noticeable visual quality loss.	2025-04-22 06:19:30.279903	2025-04-22 06:19:30.279903

131	12	10	Day one purchase for me! Will premium subscribers get any exclusive liveries or parts with this one? The suspension looks perfect for the rally scenarios I like to set up.	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857
132	12	2	Premium subscribers will get an exclusive 'Championship Edition' livery with custom mudflaps and light pod configuration. They'll also receive a tuning preset file that we developed with the help of an actual rally driver for the perfect gravel setup. Hope you enjoy it!	2025-04-19 06:24:57.999857	2025-04-19 06:24:57.999857
133	13	12	Absolutely beautiful model! The attention to detail on the interior is outstanding. I'm a sucker for classic sports cars with their analog driving feel. Will we be able to toggle between original-spec performance and enhanced modern options?	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857
134	13	1	Thank you for the kind words! Yes, we've implemented a unique system for this car where you can toggle between 'Classic' and 'Restomod' configurations. Classic gives you the authentic 60s driving experience with period-correct limitations, while Restomod maintains the vintage look but with modern suspension geometry, braking performance, and optional engine enhancements. You can even mix and match - like keeping the vintage engine but upgrading the suspension.	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857	2025-04-17 06:24:57.999857
135	13	6	The sound in that showcase video is amazing! Did you record an actual vintage engine for this? The exhaust note has that perfect raspy tone that modern cars just don't have.	2025-04-19 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-19 06:25:47.663378
136	13	1	Good ear! We actually recorded a restored 1967 sports car with a similar engine configuration. We captured dozens of audio samples at different RPMs and load conditions to get that authentic sound. The in-game engine note dynamically changes based on load, RPM, and even exhaust configuration if you modify it.	2025-04-21 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-21 06:25:47.663378
137	14	12	This is incredibly helpful, thanks! I've been struggling with getting the suspension geometry right on my mod. One question - what's the best approach for modeling anti-roll bars in the Jbeam system? I've tried a few methods but can't get the right balance between roll stiffness and articulation.	2025-03-11 06:25:47.663378	2025-03-11 06:25:47.663378
138	14	3	Great question about anti-roll bars! The most effective method I've found is to use dedicated anti-roll bar beams with specific spring and damping values, rather than just stiffening the existing suspension beams. This allows for more natural articulation while still controlling body roll.\n\nYou'll want to create beams that connect the left and right suspension components (usually at the control arms) with carefully tuned beam properties. The key parameters to focus on are:\n\n- `springExpansion` and `springCompression`: These control the stiffness of the anti-roll effect\n- `dampExpansion` and `dampCompression`: Keep these relatively low to avoid affecting rapid suspension movements\n\nThe BeamNG Pickup is a good reference model to study - check out its anti-roll bar implementation in the Jbeam files.	2025-03-12 06:25:47.663378	2025-03-12 06:25:47.663378
139	14	10	I'm having trouble with wheels clipping through fenders during extreme compression. Is there a recommended way to set up collision properly between suspension components and body panels?	2025-03-15 06:25:47.663378	2025-03-15 06:25:47.663378
140	14	3	For wheel-to-fender collision, you need to ensure you have proper collision triangles defined on both the wheel well and the wheel itself. A common mistake is forgetting to add collision triangles to the inner fender surfaces.\n\nYou can also add 'stopped' beam properties to create hard stops for suspension travel before visual clipping occurs. Look for the `beamPrecompression` and `beamDeform` parameters - these can be tuned to create progressive stiffening as the suspension approaches maximum compression.\n\nIf you're still having issues, check that your wheel collision mesh isn't too simplified. Sometimes adding a few more collision triangles to represent the tire sidewall can solve persistent clipping problems.	2025-03-20 06:25:47.663378	2025-03-20 06:25:47.663378
141	15	9	I've had good results using a multi-tier LOD system with these general polygon targets:\n\n- Exterior (visible from distance): ~100k polys\n- Engine bay components: ~150k polys combined\n- Interior: ~120k polys\n- Undercarriage: ~80k polys\n\nThe key is being strategic about where you maintain detail. For example, cluster more polygons around complex curves and panel gaps, while simplified flat surfaces. Normal maps are essential for maintaining the appearance of small details like panel stamping and fabric textures.	2025-04-18 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-18 06:25:47.663378
142	15	3	Great question about optimization! Here's my approach:\n\n1. For mechanical parts like engine components, you can often reduce interior/hidden geometry substantially. Players rarely see the inside of an engine block or transmission case.\n\n2. Use normal maps aggressively for surface details like vents, grilles, and interior textures.\n\n3. For LOD strategy, I recommend 3 levels with approximately 60% and 30% of original poly count. LOD distance in BeamNG is quite generous.\n\n4. Texture resolution matters more than you might think - a well-textured lower-poly model often looks better than a high-poly model with basic textures. 2K textures for exteriors and 1K for smaller parts is usually sufficient.\n\n5. Look for redundant edge loops and n-gons in your model - these are often easy targets for optimization.\n\nHappy to review your model if you want to share some screenshots of the wireframe!	2025-04-19 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-19 06:25:47.663378
143	15	12	Thank you both for the detailed advice! I've started implementing a more aggressive LOD system and focusing my high-poly detail on the parts that are most visible during gameplay. The normal map suggestion was particularly helpful - I've managed to move a lot of small details like bolts and panel seams to normal maps instead of geometry.\n\nOne follow-up question: for transparent parts like headlights and glass, are there any special considerations for optimization? They seem particularly demanding on performance.	2025-04-21 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-21 06:25:47.663378
144	15	3	Excellent question about transparent parts! They do require special handling:\n\n1. Transparent materials are indeed more performance-heavy due to the rendering order requirements. Keep polygon count especially low for these parts.\n\n2. For headlights, model only the visible outer lens and reflector in detail. The interior bulb and housing can be much lower poly or even just textured.\n\n3. For glass, avoid double-sided materials when possible. It's better to model thin glass with single-sided faces than use double-sided materials.\n\n4. Limit overlapping transparent layers - each layer of transparency adds rendering cost.\n\n5. For complex headlight assemblies, consider using masked/cutout transparency instead of true transparency for internal details.\n\nImplementing these techniques can significantly improve performance without noticeable visual quality loss.	2025-04-22 06:25:47.663378	2025-04-22 06:25:47.663378
